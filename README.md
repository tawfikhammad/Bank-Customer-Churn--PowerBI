### Possible Causes for High Churn Rates in Some Groups

🔎 **Geographical Disparities in Churn**
   - Cultural differences or localized service issues in France and Germany compared to Spain so we need for customer retention strategies per region.

   - Indicates that owning a credit card does not prevent churn.
   - Examine the benefits and issues associated with credit cards offered by the bank.

🔎 **Product 3 and 4 Usage Leading to Higher Churn**
   - These products may not meet customer expectations or needs.
   - Review and possibly redesign or discontinue these products to reduce churn.

🔎 **Credit Score Influence**

   - Consider offering support or incentives to improve financial health and satisfaction.

🔎 **Income Level Influence**

### Suggestions for What the Bank Should Continue Doing

🎯 **Credit Card Offerings**
   - With 70% of customers owning credit cards, the bank's credit card products are clearly popular and widely adopted. The bank should continue promoting these offerings, possibly introducing tiered benefits to cater to different customer segments.

🎯 **Product 1 and 2 Engagement**
   - Product 1 has the highest number of uses, indicating it meets customer needs effectively. The bank should continue enhancing and promoting this product to maintain high usage rates and customer satisfaction.
   - Product 2 has the lowest churn rate, so the bank should focus on promoting it to a broader customer base to help reduce overall churn.

🎯 **Middle Income Customer Retention**
   - Middle-income customers have the lowest churn rate at 20%, which suggests that the bank's services and products are well-suited to this demographic. The bank should continue focusing on maintaining and enhancing value for middle-income customers, ensuring their needs and expectations are consistently met.
